This is for my personal portfolio website. I used a template that I
have customized for my own use. Some of the customizations include PHP
script to send HTML form as email through server SMTP, custom CSS to
change alignment of certain objects, and edited JS to minimize certain
animations.

A BIG thanks goes out to [HTML5 UP](http://www.html5up.net) for offering free,
beautiful templates for people to use and customize for their own needs.
This type of open source mindset is what I love about software
development!
